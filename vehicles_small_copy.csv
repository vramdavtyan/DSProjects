It only has 43,000 miles on it and has hundreds of thousands of miles ahead of itself and is a great option for anyone interested in Tacomas or just a sturdy reliable vehicle. I'm selling this as I am investing more of my money into other hobbies and I am also looking to get into an old 4Runner, Landcruiser or Sequoia.  The truck is stock and has had regular maintenance conducted. Weather Tech Mats are installed and included and have made a huge difference in preserving the vehicle. The title is Clean and the truck has not been in any Car Accidents. It does has signs of use like small scratches and dents however they are small and the Cement Gray body color helps reduce their visibility.  Looking for $35,000 or a Trade w/Cash for a late 1990s or early 2000s 4Runner, Landcruiser or Sequoia.   If interested please email me and we can arrange a test drive and/or inspection.

The good: engines only got 97,000 miles on it, runs strong, shifts great, steerings tight, has new plugs, wires, and coil pack, good tires (bought new a few years ago and have put low miles on them), and interior is in great shape.   The bad: its a northeast car and has rust on the rear wheel wells and underside of the car, has typical dings and scratches for a car this old, exhaust is rusted and will need to be replaced (muffler is supported on one side by tie wire), brakes are very soft and needs pads and rotors all the way around (particularly the rear which have started to grind), ABS light recently came on, check engine light throws a minor evap leak code, CD stuck in the CD player, has developed a passive electricity drain (if it sits for a few weeks it may need to be jump started but doesn't happen when driven daily), and it leaks oil (most likely from the valve cover gaskets) onto the exhaust, which results in under hood smoke. Theres an open recall on the passenger air bag, I've tried numerous times to get the Subaru dealer in Columbus to replace this, but they always have an excuse for why the can't do it or say they'll call with an appointment and never do and I stopped trying once it was no longer my daily driver.  It books for $3600 in fair condition, but considering the work it needs am asking $2100 or best offer. The car was a reliable daily driver for me for 5 years and could continue to be with a new exhaust, pads and rotors, and valve cover gaskets.
